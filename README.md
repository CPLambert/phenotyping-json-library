# phenotyping-json-library
This provides a public repository of JSON files for a range of standardised questionnaires or clinical scales. Please note - These are the JSON files only, correctly formatted to help create Brain Imaging Dataset Standard (BIDS) compliant, machine readable datasets, and should not be considered (or used) as copies of the questionnaires themselves. 

For more details about BIDS: https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Users should always check the specific licensing requirements for each scale. 

Please feel free to add to, or use, the json files as required.
