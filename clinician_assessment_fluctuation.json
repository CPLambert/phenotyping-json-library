    "Description": "Does the patient ever have spontaneous impaired alertness and concentration, i.e. appear drowsy but awake, look dazed, not be aware of what is going on around? Clear examples demonstrating impaired consciousness with variations in performance/cognition are required to receive a positive rating.) Have these episodes occurred within the last month?",

Has it become worse then improved for a while, i.e. been up and down? (Significant fluctuation is regarded as present if distinct examples of differences in performance/cognition can be given on at least two occasions over the past month.)",
