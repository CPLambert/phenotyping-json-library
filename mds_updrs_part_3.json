The first pull is an instructional demonstration and is purposely milder and not rated. The second time the shoulders are pulled briskly and forcefully towards the examiner with enough force to displace the center of gravity so that patient MUST take a step backwards. The examiner needs to be ready to catch the patient, but must stand sufficiently back so as to allow enough room for the patient to take several steps to recover independently. Do not allow the patient to flex the body abnormally forward in anticipation of the pull. Observe for the number of steps backwards or falling. Up to and including two steps for recovery is considered normal, so abnormal ratings begin with three steps.
